# zillizcloud_user_role (Resource)

Manages the roles assigned to a user in a Zilliz Cloud cluster.

This resource allows you to grant or revoke one or more roles for a specific user within a cluster using its connect address.

Typical use case: manage user permissions and access control for database security and multi-tenant environments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zillizcloud = {
      source = "zilliztech/zillizcloud"
    }
  }
}

provider "zillizcloud" {
}

data "zillizcloud_project" "default" {
  # Fetching the default project information to be used in cluster provisioning
}

resource "zillizcloud_cluster" "cluster" {
  cluster_name = "Cluster-03"                        # The name of the cluster
  region_id    = "aws-us-east-2"                     # The region where the cluster will be deployed
  plan         = "Enterprise"                        # The service plan for the cluster
  cu_size      = "1"                                 # The size of the compute unit
  cu_type      = "Performance-optimized"             # The type of compute unit, optimized for performance
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id # Linking to the project ID fetched earlier
}

resource "random_password" "password" {
  length           = 16
  special          = true
  override_special = "!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"
}

resource "zillizcloud_user" "myuser" {
  connect_address = zillizcloud_cluster.cluster.connect_address
  username        = "test111"
  password        = random_password.password.result
}

resource "zillizcloud_user_role" "myuser_role" {
  connect_address = zillizcloud_cluster.standard_plan_cluster.connect_address
  username        = zillizcloud_user.myuser.username
  roles           = ["db_rw"]
}

## Schema

### Required

- `connect_address` (String) The connection address of the target Zilliz Cloud cluster.
You can obtain this value from the output of the `zillizcloud_cluster` resource, for example:
`zillizcloud_cluster.example.connect_address`

**Example:**
`https://in01-295cd02566647b7.aws-us-east-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19534`

> **Note:** The address must include the protocol (e.g., `https://`).
- `roles` (List of String) A list of roles to assign to the user.

**Example:**  
`["db_admin", "read_only"]`

> **Note:** Only valid roles supported by the cluster can be assigned.
- `username` (String) The username of the database user to whom the roles will be assigned.

**Constraints:**
- Must be an existing user in the cluster.
- Should follow your organization's naming conventions.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the user-role assignment, generated by the service.

**Format:**  
`/connections/{connect_address}/users/{username}/roles`

- `connect_address`: The address used to connect to the cluster  
- `username`: The name of the user

**Example:**  
`/connections/in01-295cd02566647b7.aws-us-east-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19534/users/alias/roles`

> **Note:** This value is automatically set and should not be manually specified.
