# zillizcloud_database (Resource)

Manages a database in a Zilliz Cloud cluster.
This resource allows you to create, read, and delete databases for a specific cluster using its connect address.
Typical use case: managing logical databases for multi-tenancy, isolation, and organization of data.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zillizcloud = {
      source = "zilliztech/zillizcloud"
    }
  }
}

provider "zillizcloud" {
}

data "zillizcloud_project" "default" {
  # Fetching the default project information to be used in cluster provisioning
}

resource "zillizcloud_cluster" "cluster" {
  cluster_name = "Cluster-03"                        # The name of the cluster
  region_id    = "aws-us-east-2"                     # The region where the cluster will be deployed
  plan         = "Enterprise"                        # The service plan for the cluster
  cu_size      = "1"                                 # The size of the compute unit
  cu_type      = "Performance-optimized"             # The type of compute unit, optimized for performance
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id # Linking to the project ID fetched earlier
}

resource "zillizcloud_database" "db" {
  connect_address = zillizcloud_cluster.cluster.connect_address
  db_name         = "db"
  properties = {
    "database.replica.number"     = "1"
    "database.max.collections"    = "10"
    "database.force.deny.writing" = "false"
    "database.force.deny.reading" = "false"
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `connect_address` (String) The connection address of the target Zilliz Cloud cluster.
You can obtain this value from the output of the `zillizcloud_cluster` resource, for example:
`zillizcloud_cluster.example.connect_address`

**Example:**
`https://in01-295cd02566647b7.aws-us-east-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19534`

> **Note:** The address must include the protocol (e.g., `https://`).
- `db_name` (String) The name of the database to be managed. Must be unique within the cluster.

### Optional

- `properties` (Map of String) A map of database properties.

**Example:**

`{
  "database.replica.number": "3",
  "database.max.collections": "1000",
  "database.force.deny.writing": "true"
}`

> All values should be provided as strings and will be converted to appropriate types internally. Support properties can be found [here](https://docs.zilliz.com/reference/restful/create-database-v2)

**Reference:** https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/blob/v2.5.12/pkg/common/common.go#L186

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the database resource, generated by the service.

**Format:**
`/connections/{connect_address}/databases/{db_name}`
**Fields:**
- `connect_address` — The address used to connect to the cluster.
- `db_name` — The name of the database.

**Example:**
`/connections/in01-295cd02566647b7.aws-us-east-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19534/databases/mydb`

> **Note:** This value is automatically set and should not be manually specified.
