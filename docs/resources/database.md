# zillizcloud_database (Resource)

Manages a database in a Zilliz Cloud cluster.\n\nThis resource allows you to create, read, and delete databases for a specific cluster using its connect address.\n\nTypical use case: managing logical databases for multi-tenancy, isolation, and organization of data.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zillizcloud = {
      source = "zilliztech/zillizcloud"
    }
  }
}

provider "zillizcloud" {
}

data "zillizcloud_project" "default" {
  # Fetching the default project information to be used in cluster provisioning
}

resource "zillizcloud_cluster" "cluster" {
  cluster_name = "Cluster-03"                        # The name of the cluster
  region_id    = "aws-us-east-2"                     # The region where the cluster will be deployed
  plan         = "Enterprise"                        # The service plan for the cluster
  cu_size      = "1"                                 # The size of the compute unit
  cu_type      = "Performance-optimized"             # The type of compute unit, optimized for performance
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id # Linking to the project ID fetched earlier
}

resource "zillizcloud_database" "db" {
  connect_address = zillizcloud_cluster.cluster.connect_address
  db_name         = "db"
  properties = jsonencode({
    "database.replica.number"     = 1
    "database.max.collections"    = 10
    "database.force.deny.writing" = false
    "database.force.deny.reading" = false
  })
}

## Schema

### Required

- `connect_address` (String) The connection address of the target Zilliz Cloud cluster.\n\nYou can obtain this value from the output of the `zillizcloud_cluster` resource, for example:\n`zillizcloud_cluster.example.connect_address`\n\n**Example:**\n`https://in01-295cd02566647b7.aws-us-east-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19534`\n\n> **Note:** The address must include the protocol (e.g., `https://`).
- `db_name` (String) The name of the database to be managed.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Must be unique within the cluster.\n- Should follow your organization's naming conventions.

### Optional

- `properties` (String) A JSON-formatted map of advanced database properties.

**Example:**

`{
  "database.replica.number": 3,
  "database.max.collections": 1000,
  "database.force.deny.writing": true
}`

> Supports string, integer, and boolean values.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the database resource, generated by the service.\n\n**Format:**\n`/connections/{connect_address}/databases/{db_name}`\n\n**Fields:**\n- `connect_address` — The address used to connect to the cluster.\n- `db_name` — The name of the database.\n\n**Example:**\n`/connections/in01-295cd02566647b7.aws-us-east-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19534/databases/mydb`\n\n> **Note:** This value is automatically set and should not be manually specified.
