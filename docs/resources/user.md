# zillizcloud_user (Resource)

Manages a user in a Zilliz Cloud cluster.

This resource allows you to create, update, and delete users for a specific cluster using its connect address.

Typical use case: managing database users for access control and tenant isolation.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zillizcloud = {
      source = "zilliztech/zillizcloud"
    }
  }
}

provider "zillizcloud" {
}

data "zillizcloud_project" "default" {
  # Fetching the default project information to be used in cluster provisioning
}

resource "zillizcloud_cluster" "cluster" {
  cluster_name = "Cluster-03"                        # The name of the cluster
  region_id    = "aws-us-east-2"                     # The region where the cluster will be deployed
  plan         = "Enterprise"                        # The service plan for the cluster
  cu_size      = "1"                                 # The size of the compute unit
  cu_type      = "Performance-optimized"             # The type of compute unit, optimized for performance
  project_id   = data.zillizcloud_project.default.id # Linking to the project ID fetched earlier
}

resource "random_password" "password" {
  length           = 16
  special          = true
  override_special = "!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"
}

resource "zillizcloud_user" "myuser" {
  connect_address = zillizcloud_cluster.cluster.connect_address
  username        = "test111"
  password        = random_password.password.result
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `connect_address` (String) The connection address of the target Zilliz Cloud cluster.

You can obtain this value from the output of the `zillizcloud_cluster` resource, for example:  
`zillizcloud_cluster.example.connect_address`

**Example:**  
`https://in01-295cd02566647b7.aws-us-east-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19534`

> **Note:** The address must include the protocol (e.g., `https://`).
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for the user.

**Best Practice:** Use the `random_password` resource to generate a strong password.

> **Sensitive:** This value will not be displayed in logs or Terraform state files.
- `username` (String) The username for the database user.

**Constraints:**
- Must be unique within the cluster.
- Should follow your organization's naming conventions.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the user resource, generated by the service.

**Format:**

`/connections/{connect_address}/users/{username}`

**Fields:**
- `connect_address` — The address used to connect to the cluster.
- `username` — The name of the user.

**Example:**

`/connections/in01-295cd02566647b7.aws-us-east-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19534/users/alias`

> **Note:** This value is automatically set and should not be manually specified.
